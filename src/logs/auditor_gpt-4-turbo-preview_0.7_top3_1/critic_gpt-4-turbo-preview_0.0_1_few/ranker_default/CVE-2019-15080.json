However, the presence of such a function might be necessary for compliance with legal regulations or to mitigate abuse. The criticism should consider the context in which this function might be used. The severity is high due to the potential impact on users' funds, but profitability for an attacker is low since this function does not directly enable profit-making but rather control.",
